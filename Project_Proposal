~The Scenestr App~

  The Scenestr mobile app is a lightweight, functional & blazing fast social utility app with
a thoughtful and intuitive UX design catered to the social human wanting to find events and gatherings in
their area without the hassle of a 3rd party such as Facebook or Instagram.
With the Scenestr App users are able to find events generated by other Scenestrs
inside the app, with the help of Google's Geolocation API.

  The Scenestr app is not a social media outlet! The purpose of the app is to
encourage people to become social IRL (In Real Life) by providing a quick and easy way to
connect with users nearby with a variety of unique keywords selected
by the user, and cross referenced with the keywords of other users
in the system within the specified location parameters chosen by each user. (???)

  The user's Scenestr profile is anonymous by default, allowing one to peruse
social gatherings with safety and anonymity, with the option of making their profile
public later. Each connection made with other Scenestr's has to be done in person
through scanning of a unique QR code giving each user the ability to choose who
follows them and what they share together. Once a two Scenestrs have connected
in person, they are able to engage in a variety of functionality, including chat
messaging, video streaming, a 'walkie talkie' type communication simulation,
and other common features like story sharing, vine style video snippets, and groups.

  For event organizers, the Scenestr app provides an array of features, the most basic version being
free, with the option to upgrade later for a payment. Event organizers must go
through a special registration process that is also vetted by the Scenestr community,
allowing users to see which event organizers are well known and established within the community,
which organizers are new and/or in development, and which organizers are throwing private and/or
exclusive events. Any organizers that have been flagged for bad behavior by enough
Scenestrs will be removed by Scenestr admin and barred and/or banned.

  Each event organizer's profile can be rated by any Scenestr on a scale of
No-Rating to Amazing!!! This incentives organizers and promoters to act in accordance
with Scenestr values and establish good behavior, without punishing those organizers
that haven't yet received any ratings. All ratings are anonymous and are displayed
on the event organizer's profile in a simple and digestible format, allowing users
to quickly and easily see which events have a proven track record and are generally well esteemed,
and what events are more off the beaten path and require more exploration.

  Each event organizer will have basic access to creating an event for all users
to see, including things like event name, date and time, description, Cost info,
an RSVP function, and other features like 'secret info'. Organizers can also create re-occuring
events, and even offer special discounts or rewards to Scenestr's for regular attendance
(think frequent flyer miles). Scenestr's will also have the ability to follow
registered event organizers to stay up to date on all happenings an organizer might be creating.

Using the Scenestr app should be fun and simple, providing the user an easy and functional
way to connect with others without the added weight of creating a maintaining a social profile.
